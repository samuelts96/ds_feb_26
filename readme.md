## About

Provide a concise description of the project's goals, main components and intended audience.

## Structure

A high-level overview of the repository layout:

- README.md - this file
- src/ - (optional) source code
- notebooks/ - (optional) exploratory notebooks
- data/ - raw and processed data (should usually be excluded from git)
- EDA/ - exploratory data analysis artifacts and notes

## Setup

Typical setup steps:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. (Optional) Prepare data as described in the EDA/ README.

## EDA

See the EDA/ directory for exploratory data analysis notebooks, plots and notes. Keep large data files out of the repository; add instructions in EDA/README.md for where to obtain or how to generate data.

## Usage

Add brief instructions to run the project, examples and expected outputs.

## Data handling

Do not commit large or sensitive datasets. Use .gitignore for data/ or point to external storage. Document any required data downloads or preprocessing steps.

## Contributing
